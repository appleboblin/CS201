The article [Why Learn to Code? The Surprisingly Broad Benefits of Coding](https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/technology/blog/why-learn-to-code/) mentioned that "Coding, in its most basic terms, is really just assigning a computer a task to do based on the logical guidelines youâ€™ve outlined. Highly complex tasks are essentially a collection of smaller operations once you break them down. This methodical and logic-heavy approach to problem-solving can be a boon for figuring out problems beyond a coding challenge." Thus, one reason for people to learn to program is to have a new perspective on problem-solving.

Hi Molly,

I agree that computer programmers more or less have a guaranteed job. With the constant growth of technology around the world, more and more developers and programmers are in demand to fill the position. A basic understanding might give you an edge when applying for a job, but I also think that having a deeper understanding of a few languages can help you find a better job or net you better pay.
